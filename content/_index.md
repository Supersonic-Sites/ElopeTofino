      Weddings are expensive. Especially big weddings. Maybe you saw the price
      tag of a wedding venue or a catering quote for 200 guests and realized it
      could be a downpayment for a house! Or maybe you‚Äôre struggling with the
      guest list, trying to decide which friends to invite...and which to
      ignore. You don‚Äôt want to worry about these financial and social stresses
      when planning your big day. <br><br>


      It‚Äôs YOUR special day. But big weddings turn the focus on the guests, not on you. And it shouldn‚Äôt be that way. You shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to perform on your wedding day. <br><br>


      So why not just...run away? Tell me your dream wedding and allow Elope Tofino to take care of all the details - the photographer, the flowers, cake, champagne, officiant, you name it. I provide intimate and meaningful weddings for 2-10 people, set in a West Coast paradise. It‚Äôs everything a wedding should be - a beautiful, fun, and stress free celebration of your relationship and the start of a new adventure together.

    desc: >
      Nature and the great outdoors is your church. The sound of the waves is
      your music. The lush green of the rainforest is your backdrop. A remote
      inlet is your aisle. <br><br>


      Tofino and Ucluelet, two remote villages on Vancouver Island, embody paradise. Tofino boasts of picturesque sandy beaches while Ucluelet offers a glorious and rugged coastline. Celebrate your intimate wedding in one of the most beautiful and isolated locations this world has to offer. I work solely with local people, photographers who really know and love the area and will spectacularly capture every aspect of your day.
