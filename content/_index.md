    desc: >
      Weddings are expensive. Especially big weddings. Maybe you saw the price
      tag of a wedding venue or a catering quote for 200 guests and realized it
      could be a downpayment for a house! Or maybe you‚Äôre struggling with the
      guest list, trying to decide which friends to invite...and which to
      ignore. You don‚Äôt want to worry about these financial and social stresses
      when planning your big day. <br><br>


      It‚Äôs YOUR special day. But big weddings turn the focus on the guests, not on you. And it shouldn‚Äôt be that way. You shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to perform on your wedding day. <br><br>


      So why not just...run away? Tell me your dream wedding and allow Elope Tofino to take care of all the details - the photographer, the flowers, cake, champagne, officiant, you name it. I provide intimate and meaningful weddings for 2-10 people, set in a West Coast paradise. It‚Äôs everything a wedding should be - a beautiful, fun, and stress free celebration of your relationship and the start of a new adventure together.

    cta: customer support.
    cta_link: contact/
    faqs:
      - question: Can I have more than 8 guests?
        answer: I wish I could say yes, but unfortunately 10 pers is the max in BC due
          to Covid-19 restrictions. There is nothing I can do until the
          restrictions are lifted.
      - question: Can I bring my dog?
        answer: >-
          Yes, we love furry friends! Just be aware that most of the beaches
          have an ‚Äúon-leash"

          policy.
      - question: Can I customize the package and add on services?
        answer: "Yes, if you would like to add more photography time, a flower crown, a
          videographer, a live musician, or a bridesmaid bouquet, I'm happy to
          arrange this for you. "
      - question: What venue are you using?
        answer: "I offer venues on the beach, the forest, the cliffs, and hidden coves.
          We live in one of the most beautiful places in the world and I like to
          take advantage of it! "
      - question: What if it rains?
        answer: Rain is part of Tofino and Ucluelet's charm. On a light rain day, I
          provide cute umbrellas. I find that most couples are game and are
          willing to embrace our rainforest microclimate and still get married
          outside. If the rain is too intense, we will use a cute hidden gazebo
          I've reserved for your wedding. Let me know if you want more details!
