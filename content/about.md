      After moving from France, I traveled around for 10 years before finally
      settling in Tofino. Every day I’m reminded of why I moved here – the
      astounding beauty of the rainforest, the beaches, the coves, and the rocky
      coastline take my breath away…and it will take away yours too! After
      spending 5 years exploring this area, I’ve discovered so many hidden gems
      that need to be shared! And what better way to share them than with a
      special couple on their special day.<br><br> 

      I’ve planned hundreds of weddings, and I’ve served as the head wedding coordinator at a luxury resort. But my passion is for small weddings. I take all my experience and propel it towards creating an unforgettable romantic experience in one of the most beautiful places on earth. <br><br>

      When I’m not organizing an elopement on the beach, I’m enjoying the beach for myself, playing in the ocean and surfing, organizing small gatherings and picnics with my close friends, or planning surprise baby showers. I love small meaningful celebrations. It’s my happy place and I love what I do.<br><br> 

      I can’t wait to hear your story and help you create an intimate, fun, and meaningful celebration, a memory to cherish for years to come.
